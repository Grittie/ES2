# Embedded Systems 2 (ES2) Git Repository

This repository contains programming exercises and projects for the Embedded Systems 2 class. The repository is organized into three main parts: C Programming Exercises, ESP32 Project, and Exercises.

## C Programming Exercises

### Description:

This section focuses on simulating the behavior of an anti-missiles shield operating in a conflict area. The program involves a proximity sensor indicating the approach of a missile to the city. The distance between the city and the missile determines the system's status, leading to different outcomes based on preventive actions. The program includes the activation of the anti-missile shield, interception phase, and handling the result of the interception.

## ESP32 Project

### Description:

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of a toy car using the ESP32 microcontroller. Components include a light-dependent resistor (LDR), DIP switch, DC motor, L293D motor driver, potentiometer, I2C SSD1306 OLED display, Hall effect sensor, cube magnet, buzzer, auxiliary LEDs, and auxiliary push buttons.


## Exam

This directory contains the final theory and practical exam for Embedded Systems 2, this exam has been taken and can not be given again therefor it is okay to have this publicly on the github.

## Exercises

This directory contains exercises discussed during the classes, covering various topics such as pointers, structs, and other essential concepts in embedded systems. It also includes practice exams.
